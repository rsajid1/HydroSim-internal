### Added
- AI Yield & Stress Prediction panel — `POST /api/sim/predict` (FastAPI) returns harvest quality, stress factor, estimated time-to-harvest, risk level, and a one-line explanation via a nearest-row lookup over the local synthetic dataset; the dashboard AI card calls it live and falls back to the client-side calculation when the backend is unreachable. Includes the backend dataset loader (`backend/app/sim/dataset.py`) and prediction tests (`backend/tests/test_sim_predict.py`) ([PR #30](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/30))
- `lib/dataset.ts` — shared, framework-free helpers (`parseDataset`, `filterRowsForCrop`, `normalizeCrop`) for loading the local synthetic dataset, with unit tests in `app/api/dataset/route.test.ts` ([PR #31](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/31))

### Changed
- Simulation loop now **replays the local synthetic dataset** for the selected crop instead of random parameter drift — one recorded row per tick from `GET /api/dataset?crop=<id>` (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`). Herbs/cucumbers or a failed fetch fall back to drift so the run never stalls ([PR #31](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/31))
- `GET /api/dataset` is now crop-aware (`?crop=` with `tomatoes`→`tomato` alias), returns rows sorted by grow-cycle day, and handles a missing dataset file with a clear error response (`app/api/dataset/route.ts`) ([PR #31](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/31))
- Simulation v1 — added the local dataset API route (`app/api/dataset/route.ts`) and integrated the dashboard environment controls; added the simulation guide (`docs/simulation.md`) ([PR #28](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/28))
- Crop planting reworked — planters grouped into rows of 3 (selecting a crop applies to the whole row), shelf occupancy indicator changed from `x/9` to `x/3 rows`, and the EC slider changed to status-only display ([PR #27](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/27))
- `pylint` added to `backend/requirements.txt` so backend linting runs locally and in CI ([PR #29](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/29))
- Documentation updated to reflect dataset-driven simulation (`docs/local_sim.md`, `docs/simulation.md`) ([PR #31](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/31))

### Changed
- QA strategy document updated to reflect the actual CI pipeline and synthetic dataset usage ([PR #24](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/24))
- Documented the synthetic dataset generator constants with explanatory comments ([PR #25](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/25))

### Added
- Synthetic hydroponics dataset added (`data/synthetic_hydroponics_dataset.csv`) with 480 simulation records across lettuce and tomato crop profiles ([PR #18](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/18))
- CI/CD pipeline configured via GitHub Actions — runs ESLint + Vitest (frontend) and Pylint + pytest (backend) on all PRs and pushes to main ([PR #17](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/17))
- Backend test suite added (`backend/tests/`) covering auth validation, health endpoint, and user validation ([PR #17](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/17))
- Vitest configured for frontend unit testing (`vitest.config.mts`, `vitest.setup.ts`) ([PR #17](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/17))
- Dataset plan documentation added (`docs/DATASET.md`) ([PR #16](https://github.com/rsajid1/HydroSim-internal/pull/16))

### Changed
- ESLint config updated to exclude `.d.ts` files, `eslint.config.mjs`, and `package-lock.json` from linting
- Turbopack enabled for faster frontend dev server startup
- VS Code settings added to scope ESLint to TypeScript/JavaScript files only
